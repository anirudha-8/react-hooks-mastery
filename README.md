# React Hooks Mastery

Welcome to my **React Hooks Journey** repository! ðŸš€ This repository documents my learning process as I explore and master React Hooks. It includes explanations, code examples, and best practices for each hook.

## ðŸ“Œ What Youâ€™ll Find in This Repository

- **Detailed explanations** of each React Hook.

- **Code examples** demonstrating practical use cases.

- **Comparisons** between similar hooks.

- **Performance optimization techniques** using hooks.

- **Custom Hooks** to solve real-world problems.

## ðŸ“– Hooks I Have Learned

### ðŸ”¹ Fundamental Hooks

- [`useState`](./01-useState/) â€“ Manage state in functional components.

- [`useEffect`](./02-useEffect/) â€“ Handle side effects like fetching data or DOM updates.

- [`useRef`](./useRef) â€“ Access DOM elements or persist values without re-rendering.

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Hooks

- [`useContext`](./useContext) â€“ Manage global state without prop drilling.

- [`useReducer`](./useReducer) â€“ Handle complex state logic as an alternative to `useState`.

- [`useImperativeHandle`](./useImperativeHandle) â€“ Expose methods to parent components.

- [`useId`](./useId) â€“ Generate unique IDs for accessibility and forms.

> NOTE - We were not going to study / discuss about `"useMemo"` and `"useCallback"` as in REACT-19 it can handles this memoization stuff right out of the box

ðŸ”° **JUST TO KNOW ABOUT `useMemo` & `useCallback`**

- [`useMemo`](./useMemo) â€“ Optimize performance by memoizing values.

- [`useCallback`](./useMemo-useCallback) â€“ Optimize function references to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### ðŸ”¹ React 19 Hooks

- [`useTransition`](./useTransition) â€“ Manage transitions in UI state changes.

- [`useDeferredValue`](./useDeferredValue) â€“ Improve performance by deferring updates.

- [`useActionState`](./useActionState) â€“ Manage action states (new in React 19).

- [`useFormStatus`](./useFormStatus) â€“ Track form submission status.

- [`useOptimistic`](./useOptimistic) â€“ Implement optimistic UI updates.

### ðŸ”¹ Custom Hooks

- [`Custom Hooks`](./Custom-Hooks) â€“ Build reusable logic for better code organization.

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repo:
